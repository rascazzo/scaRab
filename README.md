web app writed in Java 1.7. lite CMS engine. text content and dynamic navigation manage 

Hi,

Scarab was designed and written by me, dev@emiliorascazzo.it, in order to make it easy to use java web application not only as a container for web pages, as well as lite CMS.But it provides a REST API as related to the CMS. The administration back office side is not completed yet.

Install and work is not complicated. But there are more steps. It is a java project that needs Tomcat. I currently use the v 7 Tomcat. And as a 1.7 JVM. 

The directory /Scarab contains src of the Scarab project java. Required libraries are available through the installation of Maven.

The directory /ScarabWeb contains rather statics and xslt. For the part, in the development of set-up and administration. For the part of the front-end the use of XSLT is left to the imagination of the user. But I will doing soon a commit with some base-example front-end templates.

However, the xml currently workable by scarab for the front-end is served and visible from RESTful API.

Like DBMS you use both MySQL DBMS that mongodb. Mongodb for content. Pay Attention : both Mysql as Mongo. There is not choose between. You must use them together. 

-------------------
required
	jquery jquery-2.1.4 or <

optional front-End framework:
