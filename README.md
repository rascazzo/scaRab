# scarab
web app

Hi,

Scarab was designed and written by me, dev@emiliorascazzo.it, in order to make it easy to use java web application not only as a container for web pages, as well as lite CMS.But it provides a REST API as related to the CMS.

Install and work is not complicated. It 'a java project that needs Tomcat. I currently use the v 7 Tomcat. And as a 1.7 JVM.

The directory contains the Scarab project java. Required libraries are available through the installation and support of Maven.

The directory contains ScarabWeb rather static and xslt. For the part, in the development of set-up and administration. For the part of the front-end the use of XSLT is left to the imagination of the user.

However, the xml currently workable by scarab for the front-end is served and visible from RESTful API.

How you use both MySQL DBMS that mongodb. Mongodb for contentui

Enjoy with Scarab !!!
